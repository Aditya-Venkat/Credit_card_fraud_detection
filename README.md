This project tackles the challenge of credit card fraud detection using the Kaggle transaction dataset. It combines multiple anomaly detection techniques—including Isolation Forests, One-Class SVMs, and DBSCAN—for unsupervised identification of fraudulent activity. Temporal behavior is modeled using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), while graph-based analysis with NetworkX captures relational fraud patterns. Together, these methods highlight the power of multi-paradigm data science for robust fraud detection.

This project was completed as a part of MTH443: Statistical & AI Techniques in Data Mining.
